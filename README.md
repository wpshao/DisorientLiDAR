DisorientLiDAR is a novel adversarial attack that stealthily disrupts LiDAR-based localization in autonomous vehicles by strategically hiding key 3D regions via near-infrared absorbing materials. Unlike prior works focusing on 3D perception, we target the localization pipeline, demonstrating that removing just a few critical keypoints can severely degrade point cloud registration accuracy and induce significant localization drift.

## üîç Key Insights:

- We reverse-engineer DNN-based registration models (e.g., HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) and show they heavily rely on local geometric key regions.
- By identifying and occluding these key areas (e.g., with IR-absorbing tape), attackers can degrade localization in both simulation (KITTI) and the physical world.

## üöó Impact:

- Causes notable localization errors on Autoware, threatening navigation safety.
- Validated on three SOTA registration models and extended to real-world scenarios.

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense Suggestions:
Adversarial training & anomaly detection.

## üìÇ Code & data coming soon.
